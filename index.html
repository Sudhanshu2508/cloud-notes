          Cloud Computing - Definition
      
          Cloud Computing is a model that enables on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources—such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services—that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
      
          It offers scalable and flexible resources over the internet, allowing users to access and use IT services without owning physical infrastructure.
      
          Characteristics of Cloud Computing (As per NSIT - National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST)
      
          NIST defines five essential characteristics of Cloud Computing:
      
          1. On-Demand Self-Service
          o Users can automatically provision computing capabilities, like server time and storage, as needed, without requiring human interaction with service providers.
      
          2. Broad Network Access
          o Services are accessible over the network and available through standard devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
      
          3. Resource Pooling
          o Cloud resources (storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth) are pooled to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model, dynamically assigning and reassigning resources based on demand.
      
          4. Rapid Elasticity
          o Resources can be scaled up or down quickly, sometimes automatically, depending on the demand. To the user, the resources often appear to be unlimited and available anytime.
      
          5. Measured Service
          o Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage through metering capabilities. This ensures transparency for both the provider and the user in terms of resource usage (pay-per-use model).
      
          Types of Cloud Deployment Models
      
          1. Private Cloud
          A Private Cloud is a cloud environment dedicated to a single organization. It can be physically located on the company’s on-site data center or hosted by a third-party service provider, but the infrastructure is maintained on a private network.
      
          Key Features:
          • High level of security and privacy
          • Greater control over data and resources
